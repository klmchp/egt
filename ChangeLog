# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- The GstDecoderImpl class now supports custom GStreamer pipeline descriptions.
A new parameter has been introduced in the video example to allow for a custom
pipeline. For further information, please refer to the newly added GStreamer
page in the documentaion.
### Changed
- Multimedia support has been restructured. This change is internal and should
not affect multimedia widgets. The update eliminates code duplication by
consolidating all GStreamer-related code within the GstDecoderImpl class.

## [1.9] - 2024-05-03
### Added
- CMake: add support for the CMake build system in addition to the autotools
one.
- ImageGroup: new utility class to handled images tied to a palette group id.

configurable.

- resolve_path: add support for the svg icons.
- ScrolledView: handle keyboard events.
- Slider: an image can be used for the handle.
- Switch: new class to factorize code from Checkbox and RadioBox. It provides
support for an image that depends on the checked flag.
- ValueRangeWidget: add support for steps to manage the difference between two
consecutive values of the range.
- Widget: all widgets can set an image background per palette group.
### Changed
- Application: change input backend logic. libinput was always enabled. Now,
libinput is used only if it is requested with the help of the
EGT_INPUT_DEVICES environment variable or if there is no valid input backend
configured.
- Button: reduce the minimal size hint for multiline text buttons.
- Checkbox: performance improvement.
- Check|RadioBox: if the widget's text is not empty, then the minimum size
hint is computed from the text height.

holding ends, don't send a pointer_click event.
- ScrolledView: rework to improve its behavior.
- ScrolledView: no longer damage the whole box if not needed.

Before, it was sent unconditionally.
- Widget: stop handling drag events when they leave the dragged widget box.

### Fixed
- GStreamer: fix memory leaks related to GStreamer usage.
